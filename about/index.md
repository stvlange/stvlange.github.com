<img src="https://stephenlange.org/assets/img/author_small.jpg" style="float:right" />{% newthought "This is the personal site of Stephen Lange." %} It's has no purpose other than the exploration of thoughts and ideas of interest to the author. This site is hosted on GitHub and generated using Jekyll, a static website builder using the Tufte-Jekyll theme.

Stephen was first exposed to the design principles of Tufte during his exploration of LaTex markdown. The beauty and simplicity of the Tufte design left a lasting impression on Stephen that he readily implemented once he became aware of the *Tufte-Jekyll* theme.

The *Tufte-Jekyll* theme is a natural extension of the work done by [Edward Tufte](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) and his collaborators on Github who created a CSS file that allows web writers to use the same simple and elegant style employed in his published materials. All credit for this Jekyll design goes to [clayh53](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) whose excellent work has made this site possible.

One thing that is intentionally missing from this site is any and every form of advertising. Any use of pop-up windows or other cheap slight of hand intended to draw the reader's attention anywhere with the intention of monetization.

Why? First, I have a full time job. Second, this site is never going to make me rich. Third, why would I ever add things that would just infuriate me when I try to view the site? Let this be a safe refuge from the web scourge that is monetization.

Stumble upon this site and like what you have seen? Feel free to drop me an email to say hello. Friendly feedback is always welcome, unfriendly feedback not so much.
