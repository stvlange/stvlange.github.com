<img src="https://stephenlange.org/assets/img/author_small.jpg" style="float:right" />{% newthought "This is the personal site of Stephen Lange." %} It's has no purpose other than the exploration of thoughts and ideas of interest to the author. This site is hosted on GitHub and generated using Jekyll, a static website builder using the Tufte-Jekyll theme. 

Stephen was first exposed to the design principles of Tufte during his exploration of LaTex markdown. The beauty and simplicity of the Tufte design left a lasting impression on Stephen that he readily implemented once he became aware of the *Tufte-Jekyll* theme.

The *Tufte-Jekyll* theme is a natural extension of the work done by [Edward Tufte](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css) and his collaborators on Github who created a CSS file that allows web writers to use the same simple and elegant style employed in his published materials. All credit for this Jekyll design goes to [clayh53](https://github.com/clayh53/tufte-jekyll) whose excellent work has made this site possible.
