# klepas.org source

These are the source files that are managed by the Ruby static site generator [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to build [klepas.org](http://klepas.org).

## Documentation

I have written [an article on how I have setup and use Jekyll](http://klepas.org/jekyll-a-static-site-generator/#notebook), the static site generator that builds my static files.
