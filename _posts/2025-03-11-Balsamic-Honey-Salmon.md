{% newthought "Want an easy salmon dinner recipe?" %} Tonight I made one of the earliest cooking memories that I have with my wife.<!--more-->

{% marginfigure 'mf-id-1' 'assets/img/salmon.png' %}A remarkably easy and relatively healthy salmon dish. I thought it worth recording here should someone want to make it in the future.

Full disclosure, I don't claim ownership of this recipe, I honestly can't recall where we found it back some thirty years ago. But we love it as much today as we did back then. So here it is!

### Balsamic Honey Salmon Ingredients

**--** Fresh or Frozen Salmon (thawed) with skin removed

**--** 1/3 Cup of Balsamic Vinegar

**--** 1/2 Cup of Honey

**--** Fresh Mint

**--** Small Red Potatoes

**--** Green Beans / Alternative Vegetable

### Cooking Directions
{% marginfigure 'mf-id-2' 'assets/img/balsamic.png' %}
**1.** Thaw salmon if frozen and carefully remove the skin from the salmon with a sharp knife.

**2.** Cut the salmon into strips around 1/2 inch thick and then into 1/2 inch or smaller cubes.

**3.** Place salmon shallow Corning-Ware pan.

**4.** Combine balsamic vinegar and honey and mix well. Taste the mixture and decide if you need more of either of the ingredients. Adjust to a taste that you find pleasant.

**5.** Once mixed, pour into selected dish for cooking and coat the salmon thoroughly. Distribute salmon evenly across dish.

**6.** Wash small red potatoes and place in a pot with water. Start water boiling, potatoes will take around 17--20 minutes to fully cook.

**7.** When timer for potatoes is at the 10-minute mark, turn the oven broiler on and place the salmon pan under the broiler.

**8.** After ten minutes check on the salmon, they should be very close to ready. If not fully cooked to your liking, put back in and check every two minutes. *It is important to closely monitor the dish while it cooks.* The marinade has a high sugar level, and it can quickly burn!

**10.** Mash up the red potatoes with a fork, and ladle extra balsamic honey sauce over the potatoes.

**11.** Add your secondary cooked vegetables to the plate and enjoy your dinner!

What is great about this recipe is that it is extremely quick and easy to make. Frozen salmon takes no time to defrost in a sink filled with cool water.

The hardest part of the food prep is removing the skin from the salmon which is fairly easy as salmon skin is not all that fragile.

### Salmon Skin Removal
Removing the skin from the salmon is an easy process, don't be intimidated. Just take your time and you will be good to go.

**1.** Set salmon skin side down on a cutting board.

**2.** Using a sharp knife make a shallow cut just above the salmon skin down toward the skin.

**3.** While keeping the knife at around a 45-degree angle against the skin cut back and forth toward the opposite end of the salmon.

**4.** The skin will peel away as you go. If too much salmon is left on the skin add a small amount of pressure as you go. If skin remains on the salmon, back pressure off.

### Always a Fan Favorite
This recipe has always been a fan favorite in our house. It's relatively healthy and the way the salmon cooks and tastes is kid friendly which can be equally important! I hope you enjoy this recipe as much as we do.
