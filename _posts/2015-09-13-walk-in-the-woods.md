## <i class="fa fa-leaf fa-lg"></i> Unwinding Outside with Mia & Rocket

On Sunday morning while my wife, mother-in-law and son headed out to see the new Robert Redford adaptation of Bill Bryson's book "A Walk in the Woods: Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail", I loaded up my daughter Mia and our family dog Rocket into the car and headed for the trails of <a href="http://www.oswegolandparkdistrict.org/Trails-Parks/Saw-Wee-Kee-Park.htm">Saw Wee Kee</a> park.

Since I have already read Bryson's book, I didn't really mind missing the movie, and it gave me a nice opportunity to do something with Mia.  The irony of going for a walk while they went to sit and watch a movie *about* going on a walk was not lost on me.

Going for a hike can be a great experience if you spend a few minutes preparing for the hike.  

**Backpack Setup:**

 * First Aid Kit
 * Bottled Water (5)
 * Trail Snacks
 * Bug Spray
 * Sun Screen
 * Swiss Army Knife
 * iPhone
 * Dog Food (1 Serving)
 * Plastic Bowl for Dog Water/Food Consumption

**Mia's Setup:**

 * Long lightweight pants
 * Long Sleeve lightweight T-shirt
 * Zipup Lightweight Hoodie
 * Sneakers

I would have preferred to have hiking boots for her, but sadly that was not the case.  I used this trip as an opportunity to discuss the importance of layering with her.  How much of that discussion will stick, time will tell.

I know wearing pants and a long sleeve t-shirt may seem like overkill, but I know how prolific the poison ivy can be on these trails.  That little bit of extra protection can really help.

**Rocket's Setup:**

 * Ruffwear (Web Master Pro)[http://www.ruffwear.com/Web-Master-Pro-Harness?sc=2&category=1131] Harness

I am a big fan of the Ruffwear product line.  I have spent more time that I would like to admit scouring the web for harness reviews and advice and every single time I would find myself being funnelled to this company. 

A few weeks ago while on REI I hapilly saw that they carried the Web Master Pro harness, and since I have a REI dividend to spend it wasn't long until the harness arrived.  I could not be happier.  The construction and attention to detail is amazing.  It was exactly the level of quality I would expect to see from a more expensive than average harness.

Since I was humping water and a plastic  water dish and food, Rocket was good to go.  I quickly got myself ready and off we went.

It wasn't long before we are on the trail.

Out route ended up being just around two miles.  For my daughter (7) this is just about the perfect distance.  Could she have done more?  Yes.  Would she have enjoyed it? No.  And enjoyment was something I hoped she would have as hiking is not only great exercise, but a great way to get away from the electronic world.

Now, just because I was tracking out course on my iPhone and our exact distance with my Garmin ForeRunner does not mean I didn't disconnect.  Those things were set and forget items on the punch list.

The weather was perfect, a nice semi-crisp morning that blossomed into a pleasant mid 70's day.  About 1/2 mile into our trip we stopped at a nice spot by the river.  Rocket took the opportunity to explore.  I was really happy that he was wearing the harness, giving him a helping hand was much easier thanks to it.

The best part of the hike was the time I had alone with Mia.  We talked about a lot of things, and being outside and alone, there weren't a lot of distractions aside from nature itself.  We took frequent breaks to drink water.  I've decided I really need to invest in a portable bowl of some kind, the plastic bowl I had for Rocket just didn't meet my needs.

Before I knew it the hike was over.  I wouldn't trade that time for anything and I look forward to doing it again soon.
