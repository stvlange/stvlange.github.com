One of my favorite books is George Orwell's 1984.  As a reader that is drawn to darker dystopian and apocalyptic works, 1984 is equally fascinating and horrifying. And yet, given the confirmed level (Snowden) of monitoring we face by our government in the name of "Security" we are as a whole, remarkably indifferent.

<blockquote cite="George Orwell">
    <p>"There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live—did live, from habit that became instinct—in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized."</p>
</blockquote>

This quote has become our reality.  A reality not of the government's making but our own.  A gilded cage  built on a desire for faster and more accessible lives. In 1984 the telescreen was a requirement for every party member.  In our world, the government works through more overt yet equally intrusive channels.

Why then does the government's intrusion not piss more people off for longer periods of time?  For example, I have a good idea of some of the data sources that the government is leeching information about me off.  Why don't I shut them down?  I don't after all have to use Facebook, or Google+.

Ultimately the reason I don't shut things down is the same reason that I think most people don't -- Convenience.

And in the end, at least in my own case, I'm pretty boring.  If the government wants to collect my drivel, the occasional zing I make about a neighbor or politician isn't really worth much in the grand scheme of things.
