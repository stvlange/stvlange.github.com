One of my favorite books is George Orwell's 1984.  As a reader that is drawn to darker dystopian and apocalyptic works, 1984 is equally fascinating and horrifying.  

<blockquote cite="George Orwell">
    <p>i"There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live—did live, from habit that became instinct—in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized."</p>
