One of the things that concerns me is noise and light polution. The auditory and visual equivalent of sandpaper, noise and light polution is slowly grinding us all down.

Sitting in front of a computer all day for work, I really thought that I would be immune to the effects of noise and light polution.  However, I often find myself looking forward to being in a dark quiet room or outside in the woods.

Why is this? Either option helps me to decompress.  Some people might argue that society as a whole has become a slave to technology.  Look around at any event and more often that not people will be looking down at their phones.  More and more people experience life through a digital screen instead of directly by actually looking at what is right in front of their faces.

But, when we spend time without technology (outside or inside) our focus isn't filtered through a screen, we see things for ourselves, and we feel better doing it.  I read a quote today that really hit home:

>There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,<br>
>There is a rapture on the lonely shore,<br>
>There is society, where none intrudes,<br>
>By the deep sea, and music in its roar:<br>
>I love not man the less, but Nature more.<br>
>                      ~George Gordon Byron

Just being outside in nature, away from civilization has a therapeutic value.  Even in small doses, say working outside in your yard on a sunny, pleasant day can make you feel better.

We physically feel better, we naturally relax.  I know this to be true -- when I am outside, I feel better.  I will try and make it a point of spending more time outside in the future.
