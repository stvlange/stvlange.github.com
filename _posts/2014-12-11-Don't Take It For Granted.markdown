Last night my son came running down the stairs sounds like a herd of elephants.  He ran into the family room where I was laying on the couch watching a movie. "Dad! What are the fire trucks outside for?" he asked.  Not being anywhere near those windows his guess was as good as mine.  We headed outside to the porch.

I had a suspicion that was confirmed when I saw where the vehicles were focused on -- Our neighbors Lois and Brian Turk's house.  We knew that Brian had some heart related health problems but a change in lifestyle seemed to be keeping those problem at bay.

I would later learn that Brian passed away in his chair.  He looked to be asleep, his wife and children were there.  My wife and I were both in shock.  I know in that instant we both thought about the pain and suffering that Lois and her children were going through.  I know we both envisioned how we would feel if this tragedy has befallen our family.

This sucks is so many ways.  My thoughts and prayers go out to the Turk's tonight.
