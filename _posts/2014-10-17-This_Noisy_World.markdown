One of the things that I find concerning is the effect that noise and light pollution is having us all. This auditory and visual sandpaper is slowly grinding us down.

Some might call me a hypocrite for pondering such things because I work all day in front of a computer and find myself glued to my phone all too often, but I would that this is more of an revelation that anything else.

I read a quote today that really hit home:

>"There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
>There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
>There is society, where none intrudes,
>By the deep sea, and music in its roar:
>I love not man the less, but Nature more"
>â€• George Gordon Byron

I found myself thinking about hikes I have been on in the past, either by myself or with others.  I always found myself decompressing when out in the woods.  I physically feel better, my eyes, ears and mind are more relaxed.  Subconsciously our bodies crave the quiet.  I call it "Quiet Deprivation".

But nature isn't quiet, true it has symphony of sounds, but their noise isn't detrimental.  They don't affect us in the same way that manufactured audio and video does.  Our eyes don't grow weary from looking at a babbling brook like they do from starting at a phone screen for two hours.

Lately I have found myself yearning for the quiet of the woods.  In my car I find myself turning off the radio more and more often.  The blackness of night is a welcome friend. It's time to find a lonely shore to explore.  Who wants to come with?
