One of the things that concerns me is noise and light polution. To me it feels like the auditory and visual equivalent of sandpaper, and I feel like it is slowly grinding us down.

Sitting in front of a computer all day for work, I would have thought that I would have built up a major tollerance to it, but that really isn't the case.  I find myself looking forward/longing to/for situations free this kind of polution.  This might explain why I love forests and hiking so much.

I read a quote today that really hit home:

>There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,<br>
>There is a rapture on the lonely shore,<br>
>There is society, where none intrudes,<br>
>By the deep sea, and music in its roar:<br>
>I love not man the less, but Nature more.<br>
>~George Gordon Byron

This made me think about all the hikes I have done over the years either alone or with others.  It's almost like a decompression chamber out there in the woods.  When I am out there I physically feel better, my eyes, ears and mind are more relaxed.  I think subconsciously we crave quiet because of the technology saturated world we live in today.
