One of the things that concerns me is noise and light polution. The auditory and visual equivalent of sandpaper, noise and light polution is slowly grinding us all down.

Sitting in front of a computer all day for work, I really thought that I would be immune to the effects of N/L Polution.  However, I find myself all too often looking forward to bein in a dark quiet room. This might explain why I love forests and hiking so much.

I read a quote today that really hit home:

>There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,<br>
>There is a rapture on the lonely shore,<br>
>There is society, where none intrudes,<br>
>By the deep sea, and music in its roar:<br>
>I love not man the less, but Nature more.<br>
>~George Gordon Byron

This made me think about all the hikes I have done over the years.  Just being outside in nature, away from civilization has a therapeutic value.  Even in small doses, say working outside in your yard on a sunny, pleasant day can make you feel good.  We physically feel better, we naturally relax.  I will try and make it a point of spending more time outside in the future.
