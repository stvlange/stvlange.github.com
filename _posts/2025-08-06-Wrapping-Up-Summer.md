{% newthought "Hard to believe that Summer is already over!" %} But here we are once again on the cusp of another school year.<!--more-->

{% marginfigure 'mf-id-1' 'assets/img/IMG_6588.JPEG' %}And not just any year, but our youngest daughter's Senior year of high school. As mind-boggling as it seems to us, in no time she will be heading off to college to start her next big life adventure.

But let's not rush things, school hasn't even started yet. And there is plenty that happened this Summer to talk about and more that *will happen* in the year to come.

### Successful Surgery

{% marginfigure 'mf-id-2' 'assets/img/IMG_6574.JPEG' %}The biggest news of this Summer was that our daughters major surgery was a success and there were no complications. This was the big one, double jaw surgery, upper and lower on both sides of here face. For good measure they also did chin surgery *and* took out her wisdom teeth.

Because she has braces they didn't have to wire her jaw shut thankfully, and over 6-8 weeks she went from being on a 100% puree based diet to soft pasta and finally regular food. She will likely have a nose and lip revision next summer that will be less traumatic.

### Family Visit
We were so fortunate this Summer that my sister and her family were able to visit from Bellingham, WA. It's been way too long since we had seen them (we owe you a trip out!) and we had a chance to hang with their whole family.

It was a whirlwind tour of hiking, boating and dipping. Wait dipping? Yes there was a "Dip Off". What is that you are wondering? It was a get-together at my other Sister's house with the cousins, Aunt, Uncle and Betty.

What did we do? Everyone brought two dips to share. One "Savory" and one "Sweet". They were all labeled (without names) and voted were collected. Sadly neither of our dips won, but it was all good fun.

### First Family Trip Without Our Son
This was a first that we weren't excited about, our first family trip without our son. We found ourselves with a timeshare week that was going to expire and needed to go somewhere in July. Unfortunately it was the busiest time at our son's job and getting time off was not an option.

We headed to Breckenridge Colorado and despite being in a terribly small room, had an absolute blast. We had never been to Breckenridge and let me just say, it was a delight.

The town is not large, you can easily walk from one end to the other without a problem. But it is packed with stores and restaurants. And not the normal boring stores you are used to seeing.

For example, the only fast food chain I saw was one Subway and one Starbucks, both with subdued signage. No McDonald's, nothing. I loved it.

We packed a lot into this trip. I would go back in a heartbeat. Here are some highlights.

*Great Hiking*

*Arts & Crafts*

*Fly Fishing*
{% maincolumn 'assets/img/IMG_0252.JPEG' 'Breckenridge 2025 Rainbow Trout Caught Fly Fishing - mind blowingly beautiful water. I took a guided half day fly fishing trip. Had an amazing time. Caught three rainbow trout and three brook trout!' %}

*Sailing*
{% maincolumn 'assets/img/IMG_6657.JPEG' 'Dillon Reservoir 2025 Sailing - Our first sailboat experience! We did a two hour charter and it ended up just being us! Such a fun form of boating!' %}

*Theatre*

{% maincolumn 'assets/img/IMG_6653.JPEG' 'Breckenridge 2025 Young Frankenstein - Bonus, the seats were comfy!' %}

All in all a very fun and activity packed week. Breckenridge exceeded our every expectation. I could very easily see ourselves retiring there.
