Every blog starts with a single post.  And this my friends is that post.  So let's break the proverbial ice shall we? It has been a long time since i have written a personal blog.  I suppose at some point in time the fascination with maintaining a blog began to wane and it slowly started to feel less like fun and more like work.  So why start blogging again?

### New Job & New Outlook
I recently started a new job at TransUnion working as a Security Architect.  To say this is an upgrade from my previous job would be like comparing a Model T to a Ferrari.  This job is better in every single way possible.  Better boss, better organization, better projects, better funding, better senior management.  I enthusiastically look forward to every day at work.

As a result I find myself more interested in old things like blogging.  Did  I lose interest because of the way my old job made me feel?  It is definitely a possibility.  I can tell you that I have only been sick once since taking this new job compared to what seeked like a bi-monthly experience, and my debilitating back injury has completely resolved itself.

### New Blogging Platform
Previously I have always used Wordpress for my blogging engine.  It's popular, well maintained, and has a large number of templates and plugins.  Wordpress makes use of a database backend and generates your pages on the fly.  On a shared system, this can really slow down your site. Even worse, Wordpress plugins can be notoriously insecure and result in site compromises.

This time around I've decided to do things a little different.  For one, I am hosting this site on github.com.  It resides in the stvlange.github.com repository.  While my domain is still registered to BlueHost, I have changed the DNS A record to point to github.  Second, I am no longer using Wordpress.  This website is now statically generated using Jekyll, a ruby parsing engine.  The result is a generated static website.  Fast, secure, functional.

So who knows what this wil bring, I hope you enjoy what you read.  Have a comment? Send me an email at: stvlange@gmail.com.  Hope to hear from you soon.
