{% newthought "I am happy to report a return to normalcy at home." %} After all the various injuries and recoveries that our family has faced recently things are finally getting back to normal.<!--more-->

{% marginfigure 'mf-id-1' 'assets/img/serenity.png' %}I think it is pretty common for people to feel like they are in a rut, stuck doing the same things day in or day out. This could manifest in any number of ways or environments, be it work or at home. There might be a longing for change or excitement, and in many situations it can be a catalyst for change.

But when you find your normal state being thrown into disarray due to illness or injury, the disruptive effect it can have on your "life" honestly makes most of those other complaints seem petty or irrelevant. As I look back on the last quarter the disruptions on life have been significant and ongoing.

All of these items in and of themselves are things that can be managed individually. When happening successively without break, or overlapping with each other the result is a fastly depleting mental battery and at times exponential increase of stress.

I said to my wife at one point --

## Light at the end of the tunnel

I really hope that I am not cursing myself to more woes by saying this, but I think we are approaching the end of the tunnel and have successfully weathered (largely) this storm.

All in all things are getting back to normal which is such a relief for my wife and I. What does the future hold? I have no idea but it's challenges like these that make the curveballs that life throws at us easier to deal with. At least that's what I am telling myself.

Lastly, it can't be emphasized enough *how much easier* these storms were to weather having someone to share the load with. Mad props to my loving wife who has put up with me for the last thirty plus years.
