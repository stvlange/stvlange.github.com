I'd like to take a moment to talk about the book "World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War" by Max Brooks.  Before the name conjures up memories of the terrible Brad Pitt movie, listen to me when I say that the books only relation to the book is in title alone.  The book is what I wished the movie would be, but isn't that usually the case?

The premise behind WWZ is this:  A man is tasked with documenting the history of the zombie war that almost wiped out all life on earth by the government.  To do so he interviews countless people around the globe to get their stories and puts them into his report.  The government says the report is too personal and cuts the "human" elements out of the final report.  An irony not lost in a zombie book.  The author then decides to publish the stories that were cut (with the government's blessing) and the oral history is retained.

These oral histories make up WWZ and take the reader from the initial spread of the infection through the final days of the conflict with stops along the most interesting locations on the planet.  With this broad brush underlying unification, the book is free to explore aspects and angles the reader might normally not have an opportunity to experience.  The short story nature of the book makes it very easy to put down and pick up at a later date.  Coming back to the book after a while? Just open it to a random page and start reading.  

So would I recommend you read this book?  Yes.  The stories are less about zombies eating people (there is a lot of that) and more about the human impact of this fictional plague.  It feels genuine and gritty, exactly what I would expect an oral history to feel like.  Check it out.
