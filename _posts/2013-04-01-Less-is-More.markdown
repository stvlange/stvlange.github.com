As someone that uses Microsoft Word on a daily basis there is a lot to be said about what Word is capable of doing.  But ask any graphic designer what their opinion of Word is and there is a good chance you will hear a number of French words.  The reason for this scorn is because Word for all it is, is not the best at layout.  

I might even go so far a saying that repeatedly getting a word document to look the same can be a challenge.  As I said earlier this doesn't doom Word, it's a great application, it's just being realistic.

One of the things that drew me to using the ruby based Jekyll parsing program for this site is that it used what is called markup for formatting.  As I write this post I am looking at what essentially is a plain text screen that will be transformed during the building of this site with the Jekyll system.

### My Introduction to LaTex

This process is not new.  Years ago I was introduced to a product called LaTex which is used extensively in the college research venue.  Like Jekyll LaTex using a text based input that makes use of markup tags to indicate formatting options.  A template is used which the user chooses and when processed the output file is typeset into the specified template.

I say typeset because unlike justification in Word the resulting text looks like it was professionally typeset in a book.  In fact LaTex is often used for book publishing.  Interestingly enough, this is not the driving function that draws so many academics to using LaTex -- it is the scientific/mathematic formula capabilities that make every other application pale in comparison.

For me, I initially used LaTex for a slightly different reason.  I had a ton of documentation to do, and I needed to bang it out quickly and have it consistently look the same.  I didn't have time to deal with layout, i needed to focus on content, and LaTex made that possible.  And the results were truly impressive.

  "That's great!" you say, "Is it easy?" you ask.  

In a word no.  What you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) has crippled the typical users ability to easily assimilate this type of system.  People want instant gratification.  Don't want to troubleshoot why a document compile run through pdftex failed because of a coding error.  It's just not worth their time. 

I say that not in an elitist way, I love the command line but if you ask me to learn emacs I would laugh and say "Hell no, I am  vi man".  How is that different from someone not wanting to learn LaTex? It really isn't.

The road into corporate America for LaTex is one that I believe will always remain closed.  People need to be able to collaborate, files authored today need to be editable by someone with the necessary skill-set in a year, five years, etc.  That's just not going to happen outside of an academic environment despite the beautiful documents it can create.

### The Joy of LaTex-Like Blogging

Given me professed love-fest for LaTex is it any surprise that I like Jekyll?  It's simple, its fast (no database needed to generate views on the fly like WordPress), and it's secure.  My workflow couldn't be easier, I can either edit the file locally and upload it to github for rendering, or use the github web interface to create the file and paste in the contents.

Is it flashy? No.  Is it functional? Highly in my opinion.  This template, which is a modification of one used by Klepas, is visually stunning to read.  I've forgone a lot of the bloggy widgets, adds, and comments.  Honestly if you want to comment on something just email me.  This conveniently eliminates spam completely.

So that's about it.  If you find yourself at all intrigued about LaTex, are a writer of someone who wants to self-publish, definitely check into it.  You don't need to have a Linux system to run in (there are Windows and OSX versions available.  It might just be what you are looking for.
